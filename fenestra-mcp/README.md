# fenestra-mcp

A [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that lets an
AI assistant render and verify native UIs described as
[fenestra](https://github.com/richer-richard/fenestra) `fenestra/1` JSON.

## Install

```sh
cargo install fenestra-mcp
```

The server speaks MCP over stdio — point your MCP client at the `fenestra-mcp`
binary.

## Tools

- `describe_vocabulary` — the description grammar: every node type with a
  minimal example, and the theme color roles a color may name. Call this
  first.
- `describe_schema` — the formal JSON Schema for a `fenestra/1` description,
  the machine-checkable complement to `describe_vocabulary`.
- `render_ui` — render to a typed access tree, a downscaled preview image, and
  automatic accessibility warnings.
- `query_ui` — find nodes by a semantic selector (role, name, value, or id);
  a miss returns the nearest candidates to guide a retry.
- `interact` — drive scripted interactions (click, type, key, tab, hover,
  wheel, drag) by semantic selector, never coordinates.
- `check_a11y` — theme contrast, labeling of every interactive control, and
  per-text-node APCA + WCAG 2 legibility.
- `focus_order` — the keyboard focus order: the refs a Tab cycle visits, in
  order, honoring a modal focus trap.
- `check_layout` — layout geometry from the real frame: interactive targets
  below the minimum hit size, and signal-bearing nodes clipped off-screen.
- `match_aria_snapshot` — assert an expected accessibility snapshot (partial /
  strict / regex).
- `match_screenshot` — compare against a baseline PNG, pixel by pixel, with an
  optional tolerance, differing-pixel budget, and mask rectangles to ignore.
- `validate` — validate a description without rendering; problems come back
  path-pointed.
- `run_scenario` — drive a description + optional steps through a whole
  bundle of expectations (emitted intents, a11y, aria, screenshot, queries) in
  one pass, asserted against the post-interaction frame.
- `film_ui` — drive optional steps (applied first, so a click can trigger the
  transition to watch), then capture frames with real motion on and compose
  them into one captioned filmstrip. The one tool that turns reduced motion
  off — every other tool stays reduced-motion for deterministic pixels.

Each tool leads with a typed structured result — `query_ui`, `check_a11y`,
`focus_order`, `check_layout`, `match_aria_snapshot`, and `describe_vocabulary`
carry a formal `outputSchema` so a client knows the result shape up front. The
visual tools also attach a downscaled preview image and a `resource_link` to
the full-resolution PNG (a `file://` temp path), so a large image never
bloats the response yet stays one fetch away.
